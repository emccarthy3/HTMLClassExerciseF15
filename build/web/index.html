  <p> I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite
    holiday.  But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite 
    Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit </p>
  <p> If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween 
    pictures, stories, and films.  And if you join my email list, I will keep 
    you up-to-date on all things Halloween. </p>
